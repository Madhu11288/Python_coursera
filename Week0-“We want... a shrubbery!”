Mini-project description — “We want... a shrubbery!”
This mini-project is optional. Specifically, your grade on this mini-project will not count towards your final
grade in this class. While this mini-project may appear silly, its purpose is important: learning how to submit
and peer assess your Python mini-projects via Coursera. This mini-project is your chance to run through this
process and learn how to avoid some of the simple mistakes that have plagued students in previous sessions
of this class. We will walk you through each step of the process so that, next week when it is time for Rock-
Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, you will understand the process completely.

Mini-project development process
Your task is simple: modify this program template (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examplesshrubbery_
template.py) to print
We want... a shrubbery!
in the CodeSkulptor console. Your program should consist of a single line of Python. Before submitting your
program, we suggest that you review the grading rubric given below.
